:::{#hero-heading}

I am a second-year undergraduate student in Genomic Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), based at the Center for Genomic Sciences (CCG).

My academic interests lie in computational genomics, paleogenomics, and evolutionary biology. I am particularly interested in the analysis of ancient DNA and the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in colonial-era populations of New Spain.

Currently, I collaborate in research projects focused on:

- **Systems computational biology**: curation and normalization of microarray metadata for large-scale transcriptomic analyses  
- **Paleogenomics**: genomic analysis of ancient pathogens from historical populations  

I am passionate about scientific computing, statistical modeling, and reproducible research in genomics.

## Experience

- Undergraduate Research Collaborator, Center for Genomic Sciences – UNAM

## Education

- B.Sc. in Genomic Sciences, UNAM (2024–present)
