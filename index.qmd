I'm a [Quarto Academeic Website Template](https://github.com/drganghe/quarto-academic-website-template) adapted by [Dr. Gang He](http://drganghe.github.io).

I'm a template that you can fork to build your own website with easy adaptation and deployment.

1. **Star** this repository to bookmark it for future reference.  
1. **Fork** this repository and rename it to `YourGitHubUserName.github.io`.  
1. **Test to publish** your site using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch) (make sure [configuring](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/images/gh-pages-docs-dir.png) your GitHub repository to publish from the `docs` directory, not the `root` folder). 
1. **Check** if your website works or not. If successful, you should see exactly the same website as this one using your own Github Pages url:
   - `https://YourGitHubUserName.github.io` if your repository name is `YourGitHubUserName.github.io`
   - `https://YourGitHubUserName.github.io/RepositoryName` for other `RepositoryName`
   - Errors:
      - If [404](/files/images/Error1.png), it is likely you haven't set up GitHub Pages
      - If it shows the [README](/files/images/Error2.png) file, it is likely you've published from the `root` folder, not the `docs` directory

If you achieve this milestone, congratulations! You are now ready to start updating your website:

1. **Update** the `_quarto.yml` file to configure your site’s basic settings.  
1. **Add or edit content** in the following files and folders:
   - `/posts/` – posts about publications, news, events  
   - `teaching.qmd` – teaching information  
   - `projects.yml` – research or other projects  
   - `people.qmd` and `/people/` – team or collaborators  
   - `/files/` - profiles, images, pdfs, and includes 
1. [**Render and preview**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#website-preview) your site locally.  
1. **`Commit` to publish** your updates.
1. **Refine and polish** your content and design as needed.  
1. ✅ Enjoy your new website!
1. **Link** your website on your official pages to let Google and AI bots include in their search results.
